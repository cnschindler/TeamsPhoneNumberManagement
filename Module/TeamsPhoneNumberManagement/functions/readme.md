# Functions

Place all your function code here
One file per function, file should have the same name as the function.

There are three subdirectories:

+ httpTrigger: Each function placed in this folder will be exposed via httpTrigger as a function endpoint.
+ timerTrigger: Each function placed in this folder will be registered as a timer-triggered function endpoint.
+ nonPublished: Any function placed here will be exposed by the module, but not as a function endpoint.

The function endpoints are generated while running build.ps1.
